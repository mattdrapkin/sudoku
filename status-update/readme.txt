 * Required Questions                                                 *
 *																      * 
 * Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to      *
 * alter your plan for your project, be sure to email your 			  *
 * project preceptor directly!									      *
 **********************************************************************/

1. Summarize the MVP version of your project in 1-3 sentences.

We will accomplish the task of reading a list of digits as input (the starting sudoku board) and allowing the user to input in values in the form of (x, y) using standard input.  The program will check the user input against the correct solution.


2. Summarize your proposed three MVP features (bullets suffice).

- Create a 2D-array that stores the values taken from the .txt file.
- Accept user-input from the terminal and display the updated sudoku board
- Compare the userâ€™s inputs to the solutions, to determine whether the sudoku board was completed correctly.


3. Of those three features, what have you done for your project so far?




4. Of those three features, what have you not done for your project yet?




5. What problems, if any, have you encountered?




6. What do you plan to do in the week remaining before Dean's Date
   for an expected version of your project?




7. What do you hope to be able to do before Dean's Date
   for an ambitious version of your project?


Build a GUI that indicates the incorrect digits entered by the user by changing the color of the digit to red.


/**********************************************************************
 * Optional Question                                                 *
 *																      * 
 * The following question is optional but highly recommended to     *
 * answer, as they are helpful exercises if you have not made much    *
 * progress yet and also are a natural way for your project preceptor *
 * to provide additional feedback.									  *

8. Outline your planned API for your project (e.g. method signatures
   and short comments explaining each method; bullets suffice)
